## _Create an HTML copy of your file list_
Take a snapshott folders/files and turn it into a navigatable HTML file list.

Made specifically for my personal use on Windows systems. There are no plans to support other operating systems.

The `ðŸ“„snap.py` scripts are a mess and are patchwork after patchwork, I didn't bother properly cleaning and doing proper semantics on them (they could be more optimized and faster but meh). It's not as if the `ðŸ“„snap-script.js` files are beautifully written, they are awful.

Do not rename `ðŸ“„snap` when using to avoid having snap.py in listed your file list output.

`ðŸ“„snap.py` requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run, and when running for the time it may ask you to install some dependencies which are required just type `y` to automatically install them and open the file again.

### Multi Page - JSON
- Recommended for public websites, has good performance and maintainability
- Requires the use of a server because CORS policy blocks JSON fetches.
- Requires JavaScript.
- (Optional) Access to IdexedDB or In-Memory Cache.

#### 1. Generate JSON and HTML snippets:
**a.** Copy and run `ðŸ“„snap.py` to wherever/whatever you want to create a file list of.
**b.** It will ask if you want to minfy the JS file, choose whichever you prefer (minified JS is smaller in size).
**c.** After running and going through the setup, this will generate your `ðŸ“„JSON` file and `ðŸ“„snap.html` which has HTML snippets.

#### 2. For your individual snap pages:
**a.** Define JSON file location in the HTML head via a `meta` element.  
![json file location](https://i.imgur.com/V6yTKih.png)

If no JSON file location is defined, the page will use a fallback JSON file (in this case `ðŸ“„directories.json` is defined as the fallback in `ðŸ“„snap-script.js` under object `CONFIG`), so be sure to set a `jsonPath`.  
![json file location](https://i.imgur.com/z3S6F04.png)

**b.** Define the JSON version in the head via a `meta` element.  
![json version](https://i.imgur.com/TSY4f9s.png)

The JSON version can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.

**c.** Repalce the entire `<div class="header">...</div>` block from your page.  
![html header](https://i.imgur.com/3eRewHH.png)

This can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.

**d.** Repalce the entire `<ul id="files" class="view-tiles" data-path="root">...</ul>` block from your page.

Again, this can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.
	
#### If a JSON verion is defined:
- Compare the meta `jsonVersion` with the `ðŸ“„JSON` file used.
- If the JSON versions are identical, prevent fetching the `ðŸ“„JSON` file on page load.
- If the JSON versions are NOT identical keep fetching the `ðŸ“„JSON` file on page load.
- Loop.

#### If a JSON verion is NOT defined:
- Keep fetching the `ðŸ“„JSON` file on page load.
    
#### Directory caching process:
- Once `ðŸ“„JSON` is fetched tries to save JSON data in IndexedDB and uses that for subsequent navigations;
- If IndexedDB cannot be accessed use In-Memory Cache for subsequent navigations.
- If In-Memory Cache fails, do fetch requests to the `ðŸ“„JSON` file for every action/navigation (Very slow).

### Multi Page - DOM
- Can be used for public websites, a bit easier to setup and maintain with less performance
- If database/file list is big (html file size of a few megabytes), page may load slow or freeze for a bit on page load.
- Requires JavaScript.
- (Optional) Access to In-Memory Cache.

#### 1. Generate HTML snippet:
**a.** Copy and run `ðŸ“„snap.py` to wherever/whatever you want to create a file list of.
**b.** After running this will generate your `ðŸ“„snap.html` which has HTML snippets.

#### 2. For your individual snap pages:
**a.** Repalce the entire `<div class="header">...</div>` block from your page.  
![html header](https://i.imgur.com/7OoFk1S.png)

This can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.

**b.** Repalce the entire `<ul id="files" class="view-tiles" data-path="root">...</ul>` block from your page.  
![html ul](https://i.imgur.com/5nTlnbO.png)

This can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.

**c.** Repalce the entire `<script id="dom-cache" type="application/json">...</script>` block from your page.  
![html dom cache/json](https://i.imgur.com/bheLy1k.png)

Again, this can be found at the generated `ðŸ“„snap.html`.

*Notice that depending on your text/code editor of choice these contains thousands of text/lines.
I have provided `ðŸ“„_empty-script-block.html` files which contains empty script blocks for this purpose.*

#### Directory caching process:
- If In-Memory Cache fails, script reads from  `<script id="dom-cache" type="application/json">...</script>` for every action/navigation.

### Single File - DOM
- Recommended to be used for offline snapshots/archives of your file list. 
- Not recommended to be used for public websites, less performance and close to zero maintanability/customization.
- Requires JavaScript.

#### Generate HTML file list
**-** Copy and run `ðŸ“„snap.py` to whatever you want to create a file list of.

#### Directory caching process:
- If In-Memory Cache fails, script reads from  `<script id="dom-cache" type="application/json">...</script>` for every action/navigation.

### Others
Feel free to edit or mess the CSS/HTML stylings but keep the necessary IDs, classes, and data variables used.

#### Custom icons:
On `ðŸ“„snap-style.css` add a new icon type under the `/*hocchan union archive*/` comment;  
![json version](https://i.imgur.com/hHoQoLy.png)

On `ðŸ“„snap.py` under the `ICON_PRESETS` dictionary define a new icon type with the file formats it will use;  
![json version](https://i.imgur.com/yROWc6n.png)

`'A': ['B'],`
`'A'` is the `'icon-A'` defined in `ðŸ“„snap-style.css` with the `icon-` part omitted.
And `B` is the file format(s) that will use that icon preset.

By default any file format not defined will have no icon or can be set use the default icon. This can be done in the `ðŸ“„snap.py` script by changing the `USE_DEFAULT_PRESET` variable to true.

If you somehow want to edit the HTML/CSS/JS for the *snap Single File - DOM version* (why, just why). The CSS is minfied, just beautify it. And the JS is encoded as Base64, decode that and then beautify it as that's also minfied.
